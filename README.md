## Config file

The config file is written in perl's Config::General style. Every restaurant has to be enclosed with an unique tag like <rimelin>...</rimelin>.

### Configuration Options

#### name

Name of the restaurant which is displayed in the HTML output file.

#### url

URL to either an HTML or PDF location which should be parsed for lunchtime menus.

#### type

Either "html" or "pdf" has to be defined here. This changes the parsing, so wether pdf2txt or an HTML scraper is invoked.

#### xpath

If the type is "html" then you have to define xpaths where to find the "menu", "description" (optional) and "comment" (optional) from the given URL.

#### spacer

After lines matching this regular expression there is an new line injected in the output.

#### filter

Here is room to write your own perl sub/function which is run over the parsed input just before writing the output to the HTML file.

## TODO

- spacer line which inserts new line in front of given regex
- get pictures from xpaths like: .//div[@class='fbStarGrid']/div[1]/a (for Cafe Galerie, from: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cafe-Galerie/181267271890905?sk=photos_stream&ref=page_internal)
